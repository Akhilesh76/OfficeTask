A Hard Assertion is type of assertion that throws an exception immediately when an assert statement fails and continues with the next test in the test suite. while Soft Assert collects errors during @Test. Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and would continue with the next step after the assert statement.
If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the @Test and test suite again continue with next @Test as it is.
public class SoftAssertion {
 
	@Test
	public void softAssert(){
		SoftAssert softAssertion= new SoftAssert();
		System.out.println("softAssert Method Was Started");
		softAssertion.assertTrue(false);
		System.out.println("softAssert Method Was Executed");
	}
	
	@Test
	public void hardAssert(){
		System.out.println("hardAssert Method Was Started");
		Assert.assertTrue(false);
		System.out.println("hardAssert Method Was Executed");
	}
